# Publishing on the Web should be like...

### Today

1. Go to your domain, click new or edit
2. Type your thoughts
3. Publish

No dev server, no git workflow, no build.  
Yes history, yes images, yes private, yes instant.

### Tomorrow

1. Have an idea, capture it in the moment.
2. Your AI publishing agent checks it, enriches it, adds images etc.
3. You optionally approve or edit before publishing.

### Plus Ã§a change...

#### Content consumers
- Expect more personalized delivery -- they are in charge.
- Click on a tweet, find out what's happening
- Go as deep as you want without touching sides

#### Publishers
- Will adapt how and what and where they publish.
- Think about SEO in a post-google era
- What happens to the long tail of small business and personal domains?

#### Developers
- A new era means new opportunities.
- Expect new platforms and new frameworks
- Faster, lighter, more dynamic

#### Designers
- Work with AI assist like everyone else
- Expect upheaval in how people consume content
- Branding and style still matters
