# presskit
I have started a new thing.  
The goal is to have fun, and build something useful.  
If it works you can have fun and build something useful too.

1. Publish a single markdown page from GitHub with zero build. -- [New Thing](new-thing)
2. Publish a 2nd content page, and a basic landing page with HTML. -- [Serve multiple pages](multi-page)
3. Introduce tailwind CSS. -- [Tailwind CSS](tailwind)
