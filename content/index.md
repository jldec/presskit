# presskit
I have started a new thing.  
The goal is to have fun, and build something useful.  
If it works you can have fun and build something useful too.

## [Step 1: First steps to on-demand publishing](new-thing)
Publish a single markdown page from GitHub with zero build.

## [Step 2: Multi-page HTML publishing](multi-page)
Publish another content page, and an index (landing) page, and make the content look niceer.

---
_This is the index page. The markdown lives in the content directory at [github.com/jldec/presskit](https://github.com/jldec/presskit/tree/main/content)._
