# presskit
I have started a new thing.  
The goal is to have fun, and build something useful.  
If it works you can have fun and build something useful too.

1. Publish a single markdown page from GitHub with zero build. -- [New Thing](new-thing)
2. Publish a 2nd content page, and a basic landing page with HTML. -- [Serve multiple pages](multi-page)
3. Introduce [Tailwind CSS](tailwind).
4. Added [AI generated summaries](https://presskit.jldec.me/summarize) while participating in [Cozy Hack SF](https://lu.ma/wco3g23k?tk=5aQXWb).](summarize)
