# Presskit
Presskit is an active exploration of ideas for [next-gen web publishing](https://jldec.me/blog/what-web-publishing-should-be-like).

1. Published a single markdown page from GitHub with zero build. -- [New Thing](new-thing)
2. Published a 2nd content page, and a basic landing page with HTML. -- [Serve multiple pages](multi-page)
3. Introduced [Tailwind CSS](tailwind).
4. Added [AI generated summaries](https://presskit.jldec.me/summarize) while participating in [Cozy Hack SF](https://lu.ma/wco3g23k?tk=5aQXWb).
