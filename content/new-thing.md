# New Thing
I have started a new thing.  
The goal is to have fun, and build something useful.  
If it works you can have fun and build something useful too.

#### today
- [x] Create a git repo https://github.com/jldec/thing with a markdown file.
- [x] Deploy a cloudflare worker https://thing.jldec.me/ to publish the markdown file.
