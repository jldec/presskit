# Presskit ⚡️
Fast and simple collaborative Web publishing.

Presskit is an experimental project and latest platform for delivering [jldec.me](https://jldec.me). It serves as a playground for ideas about how AI might contribute value for Web users -- readers and writers alike.

### currently working
- Page content is versioned in markdown files in git.
- There is not static build - pages are re-rendered from source on-demand.
- Evey page has it's own AI chat, the page content is part of the context.

### future ideas
- Wiki-like collboration with AI for page content creation and maintenance.
- End-to-end usability by non-developers.
- Installable themes for different layouts and presentations styles.
- Plugins for content sources (like CMS services)
- Public and private pages
- Every page needs a history of conversations (with humans and AI) as context for how the content in the page was arrived at.
