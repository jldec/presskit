# Presskit ⚡️
Fast and simple collaborative Web publishing.

Presskit is an experimental project and latest platform for delivering [jldec.me](https://jldec.me).

It serves as a playground for ideas about how AI might contribute value for Web users -- readers and writers alike. It's also a way for me to learn about Cloudflare Workers, Workers AI, Durable Objects and other services.

### currently working
- Page content is versioned in markdown files in git.
- There is no site-wide build - pages are rendered on-demand and subsequently served from cache.
- Evey page has it's own AI chat, the page content is part of the context.

### future ideas
- Wiki-like collaboration with AI for page content creation and maintenance.
- Per-page history of conversations with humans and AI.
- End-to-end setup and content management by non-developers.
- Installable themes for different layouts and presentations styles.
- Plugins for content sources or destinations e.g. CMS services
- Public and private pages
- Broad AI awareness of content (not just per-page)
- Site-level conversations
- Private conversations
- Conversation moderation
