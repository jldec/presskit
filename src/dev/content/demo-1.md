Austin–Bergstrom International Airport, or ABIA (IATA: AUS, ICAO: KAUS, FAA LID: AUS, formerly BSM), is an international airport in Austin, Texas, United States, serving the Greater Austin metropolitan area. Located about 5 miles (8 km; 4 nmi) southeast of downtown Austin, it covers 4,242 acres (1,717 ha) and has two runways and three helipads.[4][6]

The airport lies on the site of what was Bergstrom Air Force Base, named after Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, an officer who was the first person from Austin to be killed in World War II. The base was decommissioned in the early 1990s, and the land reverted to the city, which used it to replace Robert Mueller Municipal Airport as Austin's main airport in 1999. The airport is the third busiest in Texas, after Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston–Intercontinental, as well as the 27th busiest airport in the United States by passenger traffic. As of 2023, there are more than 550 arrivals and departures on a typical weekday to 97 destinations in North America and Europe.[7]
